           INSTRUCTIONS
          
1. Create the bsvm directory structure with

        unzip bsvm.zip

   This produces the directory bsvm and several subdirectories.

2. On Unix systems, type `make' to build the `bsvm-train' and `bsvm-predict'
   programs. On other systems, consult `Makefile' to build them or use the
   pre-built binaries (Windows binaries are in the subdirectory `Windows').

3. Find options of bsvm
	
	bsvm-train 

4. Run the sample problems by executing bsvm. A model 
   file is generated

	bsvm-train -t 2 -c 1000  vehicle.scale vehicle_model

5. Test the classifier

	bsvm-predict vehicle.scale vehicle_model classified_result
 
   test data: vehicle.scale (a 4-class classification problem)
   support vectors: vehicle_model
   classified_result: results after classification 

*****************************************************************

           FILE FORMATS and PARAMETERS

The format of training and testing data file is:

<label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> ...
.
.
.

<label> is the target value of the training data. For classification,
it should be an integer which identifies a class (multi-class classification
is supported). For regression, it's any real number. <index> is an integer starting from 1, <value> is
a real number. The labels in the testing data file are only used to
calculate accuracy. If they are unknown, just fill this column with a number.

The new release of BSVM borrows the structure of libsvm
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). Similar options are also adopted.

Type bsvm-train to know the usage of bsvm:

For more explanation of these options, please check the README of libsvm.
The main difference from libsvm is -s and -q.
  -s 0: bound-constrained multi-class support vector classification (SVC)
  -s 1: multi-class SVC from solving a bound-constrained problem
  -s 2: multi-class SVC from Crammer and Singer
  -s 3: bound-constrained support vector regression
The option -q gives the size of sub-problems for -s 0, 1, and 3.
The size of sub-problems using -s 2 is always the number of classes.
Note that -v now stands for cross validataion. In BSVM 1.1, -v is
the verbosity.
